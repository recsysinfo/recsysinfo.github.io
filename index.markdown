**Learnable Model Augmentation Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation**,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Sequential Recommendation (SR) methods play a crucial role in recommender systems, which aims to capture users' dynamic interest from their historical interactions. Recently, Contrastive Learning (CL), which has emerged as a successful method for sequential recommendation, utilizes various data augmentations to generate contrastive views to mine supervised signals from data to alleviate data sparsity issues. However, most existing sequential data augmentation methods may destroy semantic sequential interaction characteristics. Meanwhile, they often adopt random operations when generating contrastive views leading to suboptimal performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Learnable Model Augmentation Contrastive learning for sequential Recommendation (LMA4Rec). Specifically, LMA4Rec first takes the model-based augmentation method to generate constructive views. Then, LMA4Rec uses Learnable Bernoulli Dropout (LBD) to implement learnable model augmentation operations. Next, contrastive learning is used between the contrastive views to extract supervised signals. Furthermore, a novel multi-positive contrastive learning loss alleviates the supervised sparsity issue. Finally, experiments on public datasets show that our LMA4Rec method effectively improved sequential recommendation performance compared with the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

**CRS-Que: A User-Centric Evaluation Framework for Conversational Recommender Systems**,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	An increasing number of recommendation systems try to enhance the overall user experience by incorporating conversational interaction. However, evaluating conversational recommender systems (CRSs) from the user’s perspective remains elusive. The GUI-based system evaluation criteria may be inadequate for their conversational counterparts. This paper presents our proposed unifying framework, CRS-Que, to evaluate the user experience of CRSs. This new evaluation framework is developed based on ResQue, a popular user-centric evaluation framework for recommender systems. Additionally, it includes user experience metrics of conversation (e.g., understanding, response quality, humanness) under two dimensions of ResQue (i.e., Perceived Qualities and User Beliefs). Following the psychometric modeling method, we validate our framework by evaluating two conversational recommender systems in different scenarios: music exploration and mobile phone purchase. The results of the two studies support the validity and reliability of the constructs in our framework and reveal how conversation constructs and recommendation constructs interact and influence the overall user experience of the CRS. We believe this framework could help researchers conduct standardized user-centric research for conversational recommender systems and provide practitioners with insights into designing and evaluating a CRS from users’ perspectives.

**Bayes-Enhanced Multi-View Attention Networks for Robust POI Recommendation**,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	POI recommendation is practically important to facilitate various Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) services, and has attracted rising research attention recently. Existing works generally assume the available POI check-ins reported by users are the ground-truth depiction of user behaviors. However, in real application scenarios, the check-in data can be rather unreliable (e.g. sparse, incomplete and inaccurate) due to both subjective and objective causes including positioning error and user privacy concerns. The data uncertainty issue may lead to significant negative impacts on the performance of the POI recommendation, but is not fully explored by existing works. To this end, this paper investigates a novel problem of robust POI recommendation by considering the uncertainty factors of the user check-ins, and proposes a Bayes-enhanced Multi-view Attention Network (BayMAN for short) to effectively address it. Specifically, we construct three POI graphs to comprehensively model the dependencies among the POIs from different views, including the personal POI transition graph, the semantic-based POI graph and distance-based POI graph. As the personal POI transition graph is usually sparse and sensitive to noise, we design a Bayes-enhanced spatial dependency learning module for data augmentation from the local view. A Bayesian posterior guided graph augmentation approach is adopted to generate a new graph with collaborative signals to increase the data diversity. Then both the original and the augmented graphs are used for POI representation learning to counteract the data uncertainty issue. Next, the POI representations of the three view graphs are input into the proposed multi-view attention-based user preference learning module. By incorporating the semantic and distance correlations of POIs, the user preference can be effectively refined and finally robust recommendation results are achieved. We conduct extensive experiments over three real-world LSBN datasets. The results show that BayMAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in POI recommendation when the available check-ins are incomplete and noisy.

**Towards Hierarchical Intent Disentanglement for Bundle Recommendation**,
01 Nov 2023,
[[PDF]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304376)

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a bundle of items for the user to purchase together, for which two scenarios ( i.e. Next-bundle recommendation and Within-bundle recommendation) are explored to recommend a specific bundle of items for the user and a specific item to fill the user's current bundle, respectively. Previous works largely model the user's preference with a uniform intent, without considering the diversity of intents when adopting the items within the bundle. In the real scenario of bundle recommendation, user intents modeling actually needs to be considered from three hierarchical levels, for that: a user's intents may be naturally distributed in different bundles (user level), one bundle may contain multiple intents of a user (bundle level), and an item in different bundles may also present different user intents (item level). To this end, we develop a novel model, H ierarchical I ntent D isentangle G raph N etworks (HIDGN) for bundle recommendation. HIDGN is capable of capturing the diversity of the user's intent precisely and comprehensively from the hierarchical structure with an cross-task intent contrastive learning, which is unified with the supervised next-/within-bundle recommendation sub-tasks as a multi-task framework. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIDGN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 43.0%, 13.2%, and 73.3%, respectively.

Enhancing Drug Recommendations via Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning in EHR Networks,
31 Oct 2023,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Electronic health records (EHRs) contain vast medical information like diagnosis, medication, and procedures, enabling personalized drug recommendations and treatment adjustments. However, current drug recommendation methods only model patients' health conditions from EHR data, neglecting the rich relationships within the data. This paper seeks to utilize a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to represent EHR and develop a graph representation learning method for medication recommendation. However, three critical issues need to be investigated: (1) co-occurrence of diagnosis and drug for the same patient does not imply their relevance; (2) patients' directly associated information may not be sufficient to reflect their health conditions; and (3) the cold start problem exists when patients have no historical EHRs. To tackle these challenges, we develop a bi-channel heterogeneous local structural encoder to decouple and extract the diverse information in HIN. Additionally, a global information capture and fusion module, aggregating meta-paths to form a global representation, is introduced to fill the information gaps in records. A longitudinal model using rich structural information available in EHR data is proposed for drug recommendations to new patients. Experimental results on real-world EHR data demonstrate significant improvements over existing approaches.

**Exploring the Landscape of Recommender Systems Evaluation: Practices and Perspectives**,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Recommender systems research and practice are fast-developing topics with growing adoption in a wide variety of information access scenarios. In this paper, we present an overview of research specifically focused on the emphevaluation of recommender systems. We perform a systematic literature review, in which we analyze 57 papers spanning six years (2017–2022). Focusing on the processes surrounding evaluation, we dial in on the methods applied, the datasets utilized, and the metrics used. Our study shows that the predominant experiment type in research on the evaluation of recommender systems is offline experimentation and that online evaluations are primarily used in combination with other experimentation methods, e.g., an offline experiment. Furthermore, we find that only a few datasets (MovieLens, Amazon review dataset) are widely used, while many datasets are used in only a few papers each. We observe a similar scenario when analyzing the employed performance metrics—a few metrics are widely used (precision, nDCG, and Recall), while many others are used in only a few papers. Overall, our review indicates that beyond-accuracy qualities are rarely assessed. Our analysis shows that the research community working on evaluation has focused on the development of evaluation in a rather narrow scope, with the majority of experiments focusing on a few metrics, datasets, and methods.

**On Item-Sampling Evaluation for Recommender System**,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Personalized recommender system plays a crucial role in modern society, especially in e-commerce, news, and ads area. Correctly evaluating and comparing candidate recommendation models is as essential as constructing ones. The common offline evaluation strategy is holding out some user-interacted items from training data and evaluating the performance of recommendation models based on how many items they can retrieve. Specifically, for any hold-out item or so-called target item for a user, the recommendation models try to predict the probability that the user would interact with the item, and rank it among overall items, this is called global evaluation. Intuitively, a good recommendation model would assign high probabilities to such hold-out/target items. Based on the specific ranks, some metrics like Recall@K and NDCG@K can be calculated to further quantify the quality of the recommender model. Instead of ranking the target items among all items, Koren [22] first proposed to rank them among a small sampled set of items, and then quantified the performance of the models, this is called sampling evaluation. Ever since then, there has been a large amount of work adopting sampling evaluation due to its efficiency and frugality. In recent work, Rendle and Krichene [24, 32] argued that the sampling evaluation is ”inconsistent” with respect to a global evaluation in terms of offline top-k metrics.

**Generating Usage-related Questions for Preference Elicitation in Conversational Recommender Systems**

		Abstract
	</summary>
	A key distinguishing feature of conversational recommender systems over traditional recommender systems is their ability to elicit user preferences using natural language. Currently, the predominant approach to preference elicitation is to ask questions directly about items or item attributes. Users searching for recommendations may not have deep knowledge of the available options in a given domain. As such, they might not be aware of key attributes or desirable values for them. However, in many settings, talking about the planned use of items does not present any difficulties, even for those that are new to a domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to preference elicitation by asking implicit questions based on item usage. As one of the main contributions of this work, we develop a multi-stage data annotation protocol using crowdsourcing, to create a high-quality labeled training dataset. Another main contribution is the development of four models for the question generation task: two template-based baseline models and two neural text-to-text models. The template-based models use heuristically extracted common patterns found in the training data, while the neural models use the training data to learn to generate questions automatically. Using common metrics from machine translation for automatic evaluation, we show that our approaches are effective in generating elicitation questions, even with limited training data. We further employ human evaluation for comparing the generated questions using both pointwise and pairwise evaluation designs. We find that the human evaluation results are consistent with the automatic ones, allowing us to draw conclusions about the quality of the generated questions with certainty. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of cases where the models show their limitations.

**Constrained Off-policy Learning over Heterogeneous Information for Fairness-aware Recommendation**,
26 Oct 2023,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Fairness-aware recommendation eliminates discrimination issues to build trustworthy recommendation systems. Existing fairness-aware approaches ignore accounting for rich user and item attributes and thus cannot capture the impact of attributes on affecting recommendation fairness. These real-world attributes severely cause unfair recommendations by favoring items with popular attributes, leading to item exposure unfairness in recommendations. Moreover, existing approaches mostly mitigate unfairness for static recommendation models, e.g., collaborative filtering. Static models can not handle dynamic user interactions with the system that reflect users’ preferences shift through time. Thus, static models are limited in their ability to adapt to user behavior shifts to gain long-run user satisfaction. As user and item attributes are largely involved in modern recommenders and user interactions are naturally dynamic, it is essential to develop a novel method that eliminates unfairness caused by attributes meanwhile embrace the dynamic modeling of user behavior shifts. In this paper, we propose Constrained Off-policy Learning over Heterogeneous Information for Fairness-aware Recommendation (Fair-HINpolicy), which uses recent advances in context-aware off-policy learning to produce fairness-aware recommendations with rich attributes from a Heterogeneous Information Network. In particular, we formulate the off-policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) by dynamically constraining the fairness of item exposure at each iteration. We also design an attentive action sampling to reduce the search space for off-policy learning. Our solution adaptively receives HIN-augmented corrections for counterfactual risk minimization, and ultimately yields an effective policy that maximizes long-term user satisfaction. We extensively evaluate our method through simulations on large-scale real-world datasets, obtaining favorable results compared with state-of-the-art methods.

	Causality is gaining more and more attention in the machine learning community and consequently also in recommender systems research. The limitations of learning offline from observed data are widely recognized, however, applying debiasing strategies like Inverse Propensity Weighting does not always solve the problem of making wrong estimates. This concept paper contributes a summary of debiasing strategies in recommender systems and the design of several toy examples demonstrating the limits of these commonly applied approaches. Therefore, we propose to map the causality frameworks of potential outcomes and structural causal models onto the recommender systems domain in order to foster future research and development. For instance, applying causal discovery strategies on offline data to learn the causal graph in order to compute counterfactuals or improve debiasing strategies.

	Deep recommender systems (DRS) are critical for current commercial online service providers, which address the issue of information overload by recommending items that are tailored to the user’s interests and preferences. They have unprecedented feature representations effectiveness and the capacity of modeling the non-linear relationships between users and items. Despite their advancements, DRS models, like other deep learning models, employ sophisticated neural network architectures and other vital components that are typically designed and tuned by human experts. This article will give a comprehensive summary of automated machine learning (AutoML) for developing DRS models. We first provide an overview of AutoML for DRS models and the related techniques. Then we discuss the state-of-the-art AutoML approaches that automate the feature selection, feature embeddings, feature interactions, and model training in DRS. We point out that the existing AutoML-based recommender systems are developing to a multi-component joint search with abstract search space and efficient search algorithm. Finally, we discuss appealing research directions and summarize the survey.

		Abstract

	Fashion recommendation is a key research field in computational fashion research and has attracted considerable interest in the computer vision, multimedia, and information retrieval communities in recent years. Due to the great demand for applications, various fashion recommendation tasks, such as personalized fashion product recommendation, complementary (mix-and-match) recommendation, and outfit recommendation, have been posed and explored in the literature. The continuing research attention and advances impel us to look back and in-depth into the field for a better understanding. In this paper, we comprehensively review recent research efforts on fashion recommendation from a technological perspective. We first introduce fashion recommendation at a macro level and analyse its characteristics and differences with general recommendation tasks. We then clearly categorize different fashion recommendation efforts into several sub-tasks and focus on each sub-task in terms of its problem formulation, research focus, state-of-the-art methods, and limitations. We also summarize the datasets proposed in the literature for use in fashion recommendation studies to give readers a brief illustration. Finally, we discuss several promising directions for future research in this field. Overall, this survey systematically reviews the development of fashion recommendation research. It also discusses the current limitations and gaps between academic research and the real needs of the fashion industry. In the process, we offer a deep insight into how the fashion industry could benefit from the computational technologies of fashion recommendation.

	The textile and apparel industries have grown tremendously over the past few years. Customers no longer have to visit many stores, stand in long queues, or try on garments in dressing rooms, as millions of products are now available in online catalogs. However, given the plethora of options available, an effective recommendation system is necessary to properly sort, order, and communicate relevant product material or information to users. Effective fashion recommender systems (RSs) can have a noticeable impact on billions of customers’ shopping experiences and increase sales and revenues on the provider side.
	The goal of this survey is to provide a review of RSs that operate in the specific vertical domain of garment and fashion products. We have identified the most pressing challenges in fashion RS research and created a taxonomy that categorizes the literature according to the objective they are trying to accomplish (e.g., item or outfit recommendation, size recommendation, and explainability, among others) and type of side information (users, items, context). We have also identified the most important evaluation goals and perspectives (outfit generation, outfit recommendation, pairing recommendation, and fill-in-the-blank outfit compatibility prediction) and the most commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction plays an essential role in recommender systems and online advertising. It is crucial to effectively model feature interactions to improve the prediction performance of CTR models. However, existing methods face three significant challenges. First, while most methods can automatically capture high-order feature interactions, their performance tends to diminish as the order of feature interactions increases. Second, existing methods lack the ability to provide convincing interpretations of the prediction results, especially for high-order feature interactions, which limits the trustworthiness of their predictions. Third, many methods suffer from the presence of redundant parameters, particularly in the embedding layer. This paper proposes a novel method called Gated Deep Cross Network (GDCN) and a Field-level Dimension Optimization (FDO) approach to address these challenges. As the core structure of GDCN, Gated Cross Network (GCN) captures explicit high-order feature interactions and dynamically filters important interactions with an information gate in each order. Additionally, we use the FDO approach to learn condensed dimensions for each field based on their importance. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, superiority and interpretability of GDCN. Moreover, we verify the effectiveness of FDO in learning various dimensions and reducing model parameters. The code is available on https://github.com/anonctr/GDCN.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	This paper addresses the critical gap in the unbiased estimation of post-click conversion rate (CVR) in recommender systems. Existing CVR prediction methods, such as Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) and various Doubly Robust (DR) based estimators, overlook the impact of propensity estimation on the model bias and variance, thus leading to a debiasing performance gap. We propose a Generalized Propensity Learning (GPL) framework to directly minimize the bias and variance in CVR prediction models. The proposed method works as a complement to existing methods like IPS, DR, MRDR, and DRMSE to improve prediction performance by reducing their bias and variance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the significant performance promotion brought by our proposed method.

	High-quality recommender systems ought to deliver both innovative and relevant content through effective and exploratory interactions with users. Yet, supervised learning-based neural networks, which form the backbone of many existing recommender systems, only leverage recognized user interests, falling short when it comes to efficiently uncovering unknown user preferences. While there has been some progress with neural contextual bandit algorithms towards enabling online exploration through neural networks, their onerous computational demands hinder widespread adoption in real-world recommender systems. In this work, we propose a scalable sample-efficient neural contextual bandit algorithm for recommender systems. To do this, we design an epistemic neural network architecture, Epistemic Neural Recommendation (ENR), that enables Thompson sampling at a large scale. In two distinct large-scale experiments with real-world tasks, ENR significantly boosts click-through rates and user ratings by at least 9% and 6% respectively compared to state-of-the-art neural contextual bandit algorithms. Furthermore, it achieves equivalent performance with at least 29% fewer user interactions compared to the best-performing baseline algorithm. Remarkably, while accomplishing these improvements, ENR demands orders of magnitude fewer computational resources than neural contextual bandit baseline algorithms.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Extracting users' interests from their behavior, particularly their 1-hop neighbors, has been shown to enhance Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction performance. However, online recommender systems impose strict constraints on the inference time of CTR models, which necessitates pruning or filtering users' 1-hop neighbors to reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, while the graph information of users and items has been proven effective in collaborative filtering models, recursive graph convolution can be computationally costly and expensive to implement. To address these challenges, we propose the Non-Recursive Cluster-scale Graph Interacted (NRCGI) model, which reorganizes graph convolutional networks in a non-recursive and cluster-scale view to enable CTR models to consider deep graph information with low computational cost. NRCGI employs non-recursive cluster-scale graph aggregation, which allows the online recommendation computational complexity to shrink from tens of thousands of items to tens to hundreds of clusters. Additionally, since NRCGI aggregates neighbors in a non-recursive view, each hop of neighbors has a clear physical meaning. NRCGI explicitly constructs meaningful interactions between the hops of neighbors of users and items to fully model users' intent towards the given item. Experimental results demonstrate that NRCGI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three public datasets and one industrial dataset while maintaining efficient inference.

	</summary>
	In e-commerce platforms, the relevant recommendation is a unique scenario providing related items for a trigger item that users are interested in. However, users' preferences for the similarity and diversity of recommendation results are dynamic and vary under different conditions. Moreover, individual item-level diversity is too coarse-grained since all recommended items are related to the trigger item. Thus, the two main challenges are to learn fine-grained representations of similarity and diversity and capture users' dynamic preferences for them under different conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called the Dynamic Preference-based and Attribute-aware Network (DPAN) for predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR) in relevant recommendations. Specifically, based on Attribute-aware Activation Values Generation (AAVG), Bi-dimensional Compression-based Re-expression (BCR) is designed to obtain similarity and diversity representations of user interests and item information. Then Shallow and Deep Union-based Fusion (SDUF) is proposed to capture users' dynamic preferences for the diverse degree of recommendation results according to various conditions. DPAN has demonstrated its effectiveness through extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing, resulting in a significant 7.62% improvement in CTR. Currently, DPAN has been successfully deployed on our e-commerce platform serving the primary traffic for relevant recommendations.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	In online industrial advertising systems, conversion actions (e.g., purchases or downloads) often occur significantly delayed, even up to several days or weeks after the user clicks. This phenomenon leads to the crucial challenge calleddelayed feedback problem in streaming CVR prediction, that is, the online systems cannot receive the true label of conversions immediately for continuous training. To mitigate the delayed feedback problem, recent state-of-the-art methods often apply sample duplicate mechanisms to introduce early certain conversion information. Nevertheless, these works have overlooked a crucial issue of rapid shifts in data distribution and considered both the newly observed data and duplicated early data together, resulting in biases in both distributions. In this work, we propose a Dually enhanced Delayed Feedback Model (DDFM), which tackles the above issues by treating the newly observed data and duplicated early data separately. DDFM consists of dual unbiased CVR estimators that share the same form but utilize different latent variables as weights: one for the newly observed data and the other for the duplicated early data. To avoid high variance, we adopt an addition-only formula for these latent variables, eliminating multiplication or division operations. Furthermore, we design a shared-bottom network that efficiently and jointly estimates the latent variables in DDFM. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the unbiasedness and convergence properties of DDFM. Extensive experiments on both public and industrial large-scale real-world datasets exhibit that our proposed DDFM consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Predicting the click-through rate (CTR) of an item is a fundamental task in online advertising and recommender systems. CTR prediction models are typically trained on user click data from traffic logs. However, users are more likely to interact with items that were shown prominently on a website. CTR models often over-estimate the value of such items and show them more often, at the expense of items of higher quality that were previously shown at less prominent positions. This self-reinforcing position bias effect reduces both the immediate and long-term quality of recommendations for users. In this paper, we revisit position bias in a family of state-of-the-art neural models for CTR prediction, and use synthetic data to demonstrate the difficulty of controlling for position. We propose an approach that encourages neural networks to use position (or other confounding variables) as much as possible to explain the training data, and a metric that can directly measure bias. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in correcting for position-like features in 2 state-of-the-art CTR prediction models.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is becoming increasingly vital in many industrial applications, such as recommendations and online advertising. How to precisely capture users' dynamic and evolving interests from previous interactions (e.g., clicks, purchases, etc.) is a challenging task in CTR prediction. Mainstream approaches focus on disentangling user interests in a heuristic way or modeling user interests into a static representation. However, these approaches overlook the importance of users' current intent and the complex interactions between their current intent and global interests. To address these concerns, in this paper, we propose a novel intent-enhanced user interest modeling for click-through rate prediction in large-scale e-commerce recommendations, abbreviated as IUI. Methodologically, different from existing works, we consider users' recent interactions to be inspired by their implicit intent and then leverage an intent-aware network to model their current local interests in a more precise and fine-grained manner. In addition, to obtain a more stable co-dependent global and local interest representation, we employ a co-attention network capable of activating the corresponding interest in global-level interactions and capturing the dynamic interactions between global- and local-level interaction behaviors. Finally, we incorporate self-supervised learning into the model training by maximizing the mutual information between the global and local representations obtained via the above two networks to enhance the CTR prediction performance. Compared with existing methods, IUI benefits from the different granularity of user interest to generate a more accurate and comprehensive preference representation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in various metrics on three real-world datasets. In addition, an online A/B test deployed on the JD recommendation platforms shows a promising improvement across multiple evaluation metrics.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Social networks are prosperous marketplaces where creators and consumers congregate to share and consume various content. In general, products that rank content for distribution (such as newsfeeds, stories, and notifications) and are related to edge recommendations (such as connect to members, follow celebrities or groups or hashtags) optimize the experience of active users. Typically, such users generate ample interaction data amenable to accurate model training and prediction. In contrast, we prioritize enhancing the experience of inactive members (IMs) who do not have a rich connection network. We formulate strategies for recommending superior edges to help members grow their connection network. Adapting the recommendations provides enormous value to the IMs and can significantly influence their future behaviour and engagement with the ecosystem. To that end, we propose a general and scalable multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework to provide more value to IMs as invitation recipients on LinkedIn, a professional network with over 900M members. To deal with the enormous scale, we formulate the problem as a massive constrained linear optimization involving billions of variables and millions of constraints and efficiently solve it using accelerated gradient descent,making this the largest deployment of LP-based recommender systems worldwide. Furthermore, the proposed MOO paradigm can solve the general problem of matching different types of entities in an m-sided marketplace. Finally, we discuss the challenges and benefits of implementing and ramping our method in production at scale at LinkedIn and report our findings about the core business metrics related to users' engagement and network health.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Within online platforms, it is critical to capture the dynamic user preference from the sequential interaction behaviors for making accurate recommendation over time. Recently, significant progress has been made in sequential recommendation with deep learning. However, existing neural sequential recommender often suffer from the data sparsity issue in real-world applications.
	To tackle this problem, we propose a Multi-Modal Mixture of experts model for Sequential Recommendation, named M3SRec, which leverage rich multi-modal interaction data for improving sequential recommendation. Different from existing multi-modal recommendation models, our approach jointly considers reducing the semantic gap across modalities and adapts multi-modal semantics to fit recommender systems. For this purpose, we make two important technical contributions in architecture and training. Firstly, we design a novel multi-modal mixture-of-experts (MoE) fusion network, which can deeply fuse the across-modal semantics and largely enhance the modeling capacity of complex user intents. For training, we design specific pre-training tasks that can mimic the goal of the recommendation, which help model learn the semantic relatedness between the multi-modal sequential context and the target item. Extensive experiments conducted on both public and industry datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, especially when only limited training data is available.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	The motivations of users to make interactions can be divided into static preference and dynamic interest. To accurately model user representations over time, recent studies in sequential recommendation utilize information propagation and evolution to mine from batches of arriving interactions. However, they ignore the fact that people are easily influenced by the recent actions of other users in the contextual scenario, and applying evolution across all historical interactions dilutes the importance of recent ones, thus failing to model the evolution of dynamic interest accurately. To address this issue, we propose a Context-Aware Pseudo-Multi-Task Recommender System (CPMR) to model the evolution in both historical and contextual scenarios by creating three representations for each user and item under different dynamics: static embedding, historical temporal states, and contextual temporal states. To dually improve the performance of temporal states evolution and incremental recommendation, we design a Pseudo-Multi-Task Learning (PMTL) paradigm by stacking the incremental single-target recommendations into one multi-target task for joint optimization. Within the PMTL paradigm, CPMR employs a shared-bottom network to conduct the evolution of temporal states across historical and contextual scenarios, as well as the fusion of them at the user-item level. In addition, CPMR incorporates one real tower for incremental predictions, and two pseudo towers dedicated to updating the respective temporal states based on new batches of interactions. Experimental results on four benchmark recommendation datasets show that CPMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves significant gains on three of them.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in various graph learning tasks, including recommendation, where they explore user-item collaborative filtering signals within graphs. However, despite their empirical effectiveness in state-of-the-art recommender models, theoretical formulations of their capability are scarce. Recently, researchers have explored the expressiveness of GNNs, demonstrating that message passing GNNs are at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, and that GNNs combined with random node initialization are universal. Nevertheless, the concept of "expressiveness" for GNNs remains vaguely defined. Most existing works adopt the graph isomorphism test as the metric of expressiveness, but this graph-level task may not effectively assess a model's ability in recommendation, where the objective is to distinguish nodes of different closeness. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the expressiveness of GNNs in recommendation, considering three levels of expressiveness metrics: graph isomorphism (graph-level), node automorphism (node-level), and topological closeness (link-level). We propose the topological closeness metric to evaluate GNNs' ability to capture the structural distance between nodes, which closely aligns with the recommendation objective. To validate the effectiveness of this new metric in evaluating recommendation performance, we introduce a learning-less GNN algorithm that is optimal on the new metric and can be optimal on the node-level metric with suitable modification. We conduct extensive experiments comparing the proposed algorithm against various types of state-of-the-art GNN models to explore the effectiveness of the new metric in the recommendation task.

	Sequential recommendation has long been challenged by data sparsity issues. Most recently, cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) techniques have been proposed to leverage sequential interaction data from other domains. However, accessing raw data from source domains is often restricted due to privacy concerns. To tackle this issue, we introduce TPUF, a novel CDSR model that transfers pre-trained latent user features from the source domain (UFS) instead of the original interaction data. By doing so, TPUF improves recommendation effectiveness while maintaining practicality. TPUF has three functional characteristics: (1) It is a feature mapping-and-aggregation framework that does not impose specific constraints on the nature of pre-trained UFS. (2) It incorporates a temporal feature mapping unit to effectively extract domain-shared information from UFS with temporal information recovered. (3) It additionally employs an adversarial feature alignment unit to align features across domains to combat feature transfer bias. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TPUF outperforms other state-of-the-art cross-domain recommendation models and is compatible with multiple UFS types.

	Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation optimizes user travel experiences and enhances platform revenues by providing users with potentially appealing next location choices. In recent research, scholars have successfully mined users' general tastes and varying interests by modeling long-term and short-term check-in sequences. However, conventional methods for long and short-term modeling predominantly employ distinct encoders to process long and short-term interaction data independently, with disparities in encoders and data limiting the ultimate performance of these models. Instead, we propose a shared trajectory encoder and a novel Contrastive learning of Long and Short-term Preferences for next POI Recommendation (CLSPRec) model to better utilize the preference similarity among the same users and distinguish different users' travel preferences for more accurate next POI prediction. CLSPRec adopts a masking strategy in long-term sequences to enhance model robustness and further strengthens user representation through short-term sequences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the superiority of our model. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Wonderdch/CLSPRec.

	Existing recommender systems face difficulties with zero-shot items, i.e. items that have no historical interactions with users during the training stage. Though recent works extract universal item representation via pre-trained language models (PLMs), they ignore the crucial item relationships. This paper presents a novel paradigm for the Zero-Shot Item-based Recommendation (ZSIR) task, which pre-trains a model on product knowledge graph (PKG) to refine the item features from PLMs. We identify three challenges for pre-training PKG, which are multi-type relations in PKG, semantic divergence between item generic information and relations and domain discrepancy from PKG to downstream ZSIR task. We address the challenges by proposing four pre-training tasks and novel task-oriented adaptation (ToA) layers. Moreover, this paper discusses how to fine-tune the model on new recommendation task such that the ToA layers are adapted to ZSIR task. Comprehensive experiments on 18 markets dataset are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MPKG model.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Recommendation retrievers commonly retrieve user potentially preferred items from numerous items, where the query and item representation are learned according to the dual encoders with the log-softmax loss. Under real scenarios, the number of items becomes considerably large, making it exceedingly difficult to calculate the partition function with the whole item corpus. Negative sampling, which samples a subset from the item corpus, is widely used to accelerate the model training. Among different samplers, the in-batch sampling is commonly adopted for online recommendation retrievers, which regards the other items within the mini-batch as the negative samples for the given query, owing to its time and memory efficiency. However, the sample selection bias occurs due to the skewed feedback, harming the retrieval quality. In this paper, we propose a negative sampling approach named Batch-Mix Negative Sampling (BMNS), which adopts batch mixing operation to generate additional negatives for model training. Concretely, BMNS first generates new negative items with the sampled mix coefficient from the Beta distribution, after which a tailored correct strategy guided by frequency is designed to match the sampled softmax loss. In this way, the effort of re-encoding items out of the mini-batch is reduced while also improving the representation space of the negative set. The empirical experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate BMNS is superior to the competitive negative inbatch sampling method.

	Effective exercise recommendation is crucial for guiding students' learning trajectories and fostering their interest in the subject matter. However, the vast exercise resource and the varying learning abilities of individual students pose a significant challenge in selecting appropriate exercise questions. Collaborative filtering-based methods often struggle with recommending suitable exercises, while deep learning-based methods lack explanation, limiting their practical adoption. To address these limitations, this paper proposes KG4Ex, a knowledge graph-based exercise recommendation method. KG4Ex facilitates the matching of diverse students with suitable exercises while providing recommendation reasons. Specifically, we introduce a feature extraction module to represent students' learning states and construct a knowledge graph for exercise recommendation. This knowledge graph comprises three key entities (knowledge concepts, students, and exercises) and their interrelationships, and can be used to recommend suitable exercises. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and expert interviews demonstrate the superiority of KG4Ex over existing baseline methods and highlight its strong explainability.

	Historical behaviors have shown great effect and potential in various prediction tasks, including recommendation and information retrieval. The overall historical behaviors are various but noisy while search behaviors are always sparse. Most existing approaches in personalized search ranking adopt the sparse search behaviors to learn representation with bottleneck, which do not sufficiently exploit the crucial long-term interest. In fact, there is no doubt that user long-term interest is various but noisy for instant search, and how to exploit it well still remains an open problem.
	To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose a novel model named Query-dominant user Interest Network (QIN), including two cascade units to filter the raw user behaviors and reweigh the behavior subsequences. Specifically, we propose a relevance search unit (RSU), which aims to search a subsequence relevant to the query first and then search the sub-subsequences relevant to the target item. These items are then fed into an attention unit called Fused Attention Unit (FAU). It should be able to calculate attention scores from the ID field and attribute field separately, and then adaptively fuse the item embedding and content embedding based on the user engagement of past period. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods. The QIN now has been successfully deployed on Kuaishou search, an online video search platform, and obtained 7.6% improvement on CTR.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	GNN-based recommender systems have shown their vulnerability to shilling attacks in recent studies. By conducting shilling attacks on recommender systems, the attackers aim to have homogeneous impacts on all users. However, such indiscriminate attacks suffer from a waste of resources because even if the target item is promoted to users who are not interested, they are unlikely to click on them. In this paper, we conduct targeted shilling attacks in GNN-based recommender systems. By automatically constructing the features and edges of the fake users, our proposed framework AutoAttack achieves accurate attacks on a specific group of users while minimizing the impact on non-target users. Specifically, the features of fake users are generated based on a similarity function, which is optimized according to the features of target users. The structure of fake users is learned by conducting spectral clustering on the target users based on their graph Laplacian matrix, which contains the degree and adjacency information that provides guidance to the edge generation of fake users. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets in different GNN-based RS and evaluate the performance of our method on the shilling attack and recommendation tasks comprehensively, showing the effectiveness and flexibility of our framework.

This has given rise to a unique shopping behavior involving baskets - sets of items purchased together. As a less studied interaction mode in the community, the question of how should shopping basket complement personalized recommendation systems remains under-explored. While previous attempts focused on jointly modeling user purchases and baskets, the distinct semantic nature of these elements can introduce noise when directly integrated. This noise negatively impacts the model's performance, further exacerbated by significant noise (e.g., a user is misled to click an item or recognizes it as uninteresting after consuming it) within both user and basket behaviors. In order to cope with the above difficulties, we propose a novel Basket recommendation framework via Noise-tolerated Contrastive Learning, named BNCL, to handle the noise existing in the cross-behavior integration and within-behavior modeling. First, we represent the basket-item interactions as the hypergraph to model the complex basket behavior, where all items appearing in the same basket are treated as a single hyperedge. Second, cross-behavior contrastive learning is designed to suppress the noise during the fusion of diverse behaviors. Next, to further inhibit the within-behavior noise of the user and basket interactions, we propose to exploit invariant properties of the recommenders w.r.t augmentations through within-behavior contrastive learning. A novel consistency-aware augmentation approach is further designed to better identify the noisy interactions with the consideration of the above two types of interactions. Our framework BNCL offers a generic training paradigm that is applicable to different backbones. Extensive experiments on three shopping transaction datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	In this paper, we present empirical studies on conversational recommendation tasks using representative large language models in a zero-shot setting with three primary contributions. (1) Data: To gain insights into model behavior in "in-the-wild" conversational recommendation scenarios, we construct a new dataset of recommendation-related conversations by scraping a popular discussion website. This is the largest public real-world conversational recommendation dataset to date. (2) Evaluation: On the new dataset and two existing conversational recommendation datasets, we observe that even without fine-tuning, large language models can outperform existing fine-tuned conversational recommendation models. (3) Analysis: We propose various probing tasks to investigate the mechanisms behind the remarkable performance of large language models in conversational recommendation. We analyze both the large language models' behaviors and the characteristics of the datasets, providing a holistic understanding of the models' effectiveness, limitations and suggesting directions for the design of future conversational recommenders.

Causal Inference for Knowledge Graph Based Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9996555
https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10046
Abstract:
Knowledge Graph (KG), as a side-information, tends to be utilized to supplement the collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation model. By mapping items with the entities in KGs, prior studies mostly extract the knowledge information from the KGs and inject it into the representations of users and items. Despite their remarkable performance, they fail to model the user preference on attribute in the KG, since they ignore that (1) the structure information of KG may hinder the user preference learning, and (2) the user's interacted attributes will result in the bias issue on the similarity scores. With the help of causality tools, we construct the causal-effect relation between the variables in KG-based recommendation and identify the reasons causing the mentioned challenges. Accordingly, we develop a new framework, termed Knowledge Graph-based Causal Recommendation (KGCR), which implements the deconfounded user preference learning and adopts counterfactual inference to eliminate bias in the similarity scoring. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed model on three datasets, including Amazon-book, LastFM, and Yelp2018 datasets. By conducting extensive experiments on the datasets, we demonstrate that KGCR outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, such as KGNN-LS (Wang et al., 2019), KGAT (Wang et al., 2019) and KGIN (Wang et al., 2021).


Contrastive Proxy Kernel Stein Path Alignment for Cross-Domain Cold-Start Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10005854
abstract
Cross-Domain Recommendation has been popularly studied to utilize different domain knowledge to solve the cold-start problem in recommender systems. In this paper, we focus on the Cross-Domain Cold-Start Recommendation ( CDCSR ) problem. That is, how to leverage the information from a source domain, where items are ’warm’, to improve the recommendation performance of a target domain, where items are ’cold’. It has two main challenges, i.e., (1) how to efficiently reduce the discrepancy between the latent embedding distribution across domains and (2) how to generate more robust and stable cold item embeddings. To address these two challenges, we propose CPKSPA , a cross-domain recommendation framework for the CDCSR problem. CPKSPA contains three modules, i.e., rating prediction module, embedding distribution alignment module, and contrastive augmentation module. To start with, we first utilize the rating prediction module to model user-item interactions. To solve the first challenge, we propose proxy Stein path alignment with typical-subgroup discovering algorithm in the embedding distribution alignment module. To tackle the second challenge, we propose the contrastive augmentation module which adopts contrastive augmentation learning to generate more stable and robust cold item embeddings. Our empirical study on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrates that CPKSPA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.


Dual-View Preference Learning for Adaptive Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10015846
arxiv: 
Abstract:
While recommendation systems have been widely deployed, most existing approaches only capture user preferences in the macro-view , i.e., the user's general interest across all kinds of items. However, in real-world scenarios, user preferences could vary with items of different natures, which we call the micro-view . Both views are crucial for fully personalized recommendation, where an underpinning macro-view governs a multitude of finer-grained preferences in the micro-view. To model the dual views, in this paper, we propose a novel model called Dual-View Adaptive Recommendation (DVAR). In DVAR, we formulate the micro-view based on item categories, and further integrate it with the macro-view. Moreover, DVAR is designed to be adaptive, which is capable of automatically adapting to the dual-view preferences in response to different input users and item categories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate user preferences in macro- and micro- views in an adaptive way, without relying on additional side information such as text reviews. Finally, we conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on several real-world datasets. Empirical results not only show that DVAR can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art recommendation systems, but also demonstrate the benefit and interpretability of the dual views.


Leveraging Long Short-Term User Preference in Conversational Recommendation via Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9964317
Conversational recommender systems (CRS) endow traditional recommender systems with the capability of dynamically obtaining users’ short-term preferences for items and attributes through interactive dialogues. There are three core challenges for CRS, including the intelligent decisions for what attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at each conversation turn. Previous methods mainly leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to learn conversational recommendation policies for solving one or two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated conversation and recommendation components. These approaches restrict the scalability and generality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In the light of these challenges, we tackle these three decision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to leverage different features that are important to each sub-problem and facilitate better unified policy learning in CRS, we propose two novel multi-agent RL-based frameworks, namely Independent and Hierarchical Multi-Agent UNIfied COnversational RecommeNders (IMA-UNICORN and HMA-UNICORN), respectively. In specific, two low-level agents enrich the state representations for attribute prediction and item recommendation, by combining the long-term user preference information from the historical interaction data and the short-term user preference information from the conversation history. A high-level meta agent is responsible for coordinating the low-level agents to adaptively make the final decision. Experimental results on four benchmark CRS datasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed frameworks significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. Extensive analyses further demonstrate the superior scalability of the MARL frameworks on the multi-round conversational recommendation.


Reinforcement Learning Based Path Exploration for Sequential Explainable Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10018538
arxiv: 
abstract:
Recent advances in path-based explainable recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention thanks to the rich information from knowledge graphs. Most existing explainable recommendations only utilize static knowledge graphs and ignore the dynamic user-item evolutions, leading to less convincing and inaccurate explanations. Although some works boost the performance and explainability of recommendations through modeling the user's temporal sequential behavior, most of them either only focus on modeling the user's sequential interactions within a path or independently and separately of the recommendation mechanism. Moreover, some path-based explainable recommendations use random selection or traditional machine learning methods to decrease the volume of explainable paths, which cannot guarantee high quality of the explainable paths for the recommendation. To deal with the problem, recent path exploration use reinforcement learning to improve diversity and quality. However, unsupervised training leads to low-efficiency path exploration. Therefore, we propose a novel T emporal M eta-path Guided E xplainable R ecommendation leveraging R einforcement L earning ( TMER-RL ), which utilizes supervised reinforcement learning to explore item-item paths between consecutive items with attention mechanisms to sequentially model dynamic user-item evolutions on a dynamic knowledge graph for the explainable recommendation. Extensive evaluations of TMER-RL on two real-world datasets show state-of-the-art performance compared to recent strong baselines.


Semantic and Structural View Fusion Modeling for Social Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9996130
Abstract:
Existing studies have shown that user-item interaction data and social relation data can be jointly used for enhancing the performance of social recommendation. However, limited research has a focus on investigating how to deeply exploit different views of social interaction structures and rating behavior differences for further improving social recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we propose to integrate information from both semantic and structural views for social recommendation. Specifically, we first design a collective intelligence-based strategy to reveal high-quality implicit relations for both users and items. Then, by reformulating all available nodes and relations as a heterogeneous graph, we define multiple semantic metapaths to capture diverse preferences for comprehensive user and item representations. While various metapaths enlarge the representation capacity of users and items, they also introduce noise and irrelevant information. We recall that, for the user-item interaction graph, different structure sizes (e.g., local and global structures) provide diverse and complementary information for recommendation. Motivated by this, we propose a semantic and structural view fusion framework for social recommendation (S4Rec), which consists of a deep graph model and a wide attentive SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model for rating prediction by taking the local and global structure as input and aggregating messages along the predefined metapaths. Finally, the two predicted results are adaptively fused to achieve the final both accurate and stable prediction. In addition, we treat the user's rating behavior difference as the relative position difference problem in the embedding space, and model it with TransH to improve the generalization ability of the main rating model. Extensive experiments on three open datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared with state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, our model outperforms other baseli...
