		Abstract
	</summary>
	Fashion recommendation is a key research field in computational fashion research and has attracted considerable interest in the computer vision, multimedia, and information retrieval communities in recent years. Due to the great demand for applications, various fashion recommendation tasks, such as personalized fashion product recommendation, complementary (mix-and-match) recommendation, and outfit recommendation, have been posed and explored in the literature. The continuing research attention and advances impel us to look back and in-depth into the field for a better understanding. In this paper, we comprehensively review recent research efforts on fashion recommendation from a technological perspective. We first introduce fashion recommendation at a macro level and analyse its characteristics and differences with general recommendation tasks. We then clearly categorize different fashion recommendation efforts into several sub-tasks and focus on each sub-task in terms of its problem formulation, research focus, state-of-the-art methods, and limitations. We also summarize the datasets proposed in the literature for use in fashion recommendation studies to give readers a brief illustration. Finally, we discuss several promising directions for future research in this field. Overall, this survey systematically reviews the development of fashion recommendation research. It also discusses the current limitations and gaps between academic research and the real needs of the fashion industry. In the process, we offer a deep insight into how the fashion industry could benefit from the computational technologies of fashion recommendation.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	The textile and apparel industries have grown tremendously over the past few years. Customers no longer have to visit many stores, stand in long queues, or try on garments in dressing rooms, as millions of products are now available in online catalogs. However, given the plethora of options available, an effective recommendation system is necessary to properly sort, order, and communicate relevant product material or information to users. Effective fashion recommender systems (RSs) can have a noticeable impact on billions of customers’ shopping experiences and increase sales and revenues on the provider side.
	The goal of this survey is to provide a review of RSs that operate in the specific vertical domain of garment and fashion products. We have identified the most pressing challenges in fashion RS research and created a taxonomy that categorizes the literature according to the objective they are trying to accomplish (e.g., item or outfit recommendation, size recommendation, and explainability, among others) and type of side information (users, items, context). We have also identified the most important evaluation goals and perspectives (outfit generation, outfit recommendation, pairing recommendation, and fill-in-the-blank outfit compatibility prediction) and the most commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics.

Causal Inference for Knowledge Graph Based Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9996555
https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10046
Abstract:
Knowledge Graph (KG), as a side-information, tends to be utilized to supplement the collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation model. By mapping items with the entities in KGs, prior studies mostly extract the knowledge information from the KGs and inject it into the representations of users and items. Despite their remarkable performance, they fail to model the user preference on attribute in the KG, since they ignore that (1) the structure information of KG may hinder the user preference learning, and (2) the user's interacted attributes will result in the bias issue on the similarity scores. With the help of causality tools, we construct the causal-effect relation between the variables in KG-based recommendation and identify the reasons causing the mentioned challenges. Accordingly, we develop a new framework, termed Knowledge Graph-based Causal Recommendation (KGCR), which implements the deconfounded user preference learning and adopts counterfactual inference to eliminate bias in the similarity scoring. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed model on three datasets, including Amazon-book, LastFM, and Yelp2018 datasets. By conducting extensive experiments on the datasets, we demonstrate that KGCR outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, such as KGNN-LS (Wang et al., 2019), KGAT (Wang et al., 2019) and KGIN (Wang et al., 2021).


Contrastive Proxy Kernel Stein Path Alignment for Cross-Domain Cold-Start Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10005854
abstract
Cross-Domain Recommendation has been popularly studied to utilize different domain knowledge to solve the cold-start problem in recommender systems. In this paper, we focus on the Cross-Domain Cold-Start Recommendation ( CDCSR ) problem. That is, how to leverage the information from a source domain, where items are ’warm’, to improve the recommendation performance of a target domain, where items are ’cold’. It has two main challenges, i.e., (1) how to efficiently reduce the discrepancy between the latent embedding distribution across domains and (2) how to generate more robust and stable cold item embeddings. To address these two challenges, we propose CPKSPA , a cross-domain recommendation framework for the CDCSR problem. CPKSPA contains three modules, i.e., rating prediction module, embedding distribution alignment module, and contrastive augmentation module. To start with, we first utilize the rating prediction module to model user-item interactions. To solve the first challenge, we propose proxy Stein path alignment with typical-subgroup discovering algorithm in the embedding distribution alignment module. To tackle the second challenge, we propose the contrastive augmentation module which adopts contrastive augmentation learning to generate more stable and robust cold item embeddings. Our empirical study on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrates that CPKSPA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.


Dual-View Preference Learning for Adaptive Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10015846
arxiv: 
Abstract:
While recommendation systems have been widely deployed, most existing approaches only capture user preferences in the macro-view , i.e., the user's general interest across all kinds of items. However, in real-world scenarios, user preferences could vary with items of different natures, which we call the micro-view . Both views are crucial for fully personalized recommendation, where an underpinning macro-view governs a multitude of finer-grained preferences in the micro-view. To model the dual views, in this paper, we propose a novel model called Dual-View Adaptive Recommendation (DVAR). In DVAR, we formulate the micro-view based on item categories, and further integrate it with the macro-view. Moreover, DVAR is designed to be adaptive, which is capable of automatically adapting to the dual-view preferences in response to different input users and item categories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate user preferences in macro- and micro- views in an adaptive way, without relying on additional side information such as text reviews. Finally, we conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on several real-world datasets. Empirical results not only show that DVAR can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art recommendation systems, but also demonstrate the benefit and interpretability of the dual views.


Leveraging Long Short-Term User Preference in Conversational Recommendation via Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9964317
Conversational recommender systems (CRS) endow traditional recommender systems with the capability of dynamically obtaining users’ short-term preferences for items and attributes through interactive dialogues. There are three core challenges for CRS, including the intelligent decisions for what attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at each conversation turn. Previous methods mainly leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to learn conversational recommendation policies for solving one or two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated conversation and recommendation components. These approaches restrict the scalability and generality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In the light of these challenges, we tackle these three decision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to leverage different features that are important to each sub-problem and facilitate better unified policy learning in CRS, we propose two novel multi-agent RL-based frameworks, namely Independent and Hierarchical Multi-Agent UNIfied COnversational RecommeNders (IMA-UNICORN and HMA-UNICORN), respectively. In specific, two low-level agents enrich the state representations for attribute prediction and item recommendation, by combining the long-term user preference information from the historical interaction data and the short-term user preference information from the conversation history. A high-level meta agent is responsible for coordinating the low-level agents to adaptively make the final decision. Experimental results on four benchmark CRS datasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed frameworks significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. Extensive analyses further demonstrate the superior scalability of the MARL frameworks on the multi-round conversational recommendation.


Reinforcement Learning Based Path Exploration for Sequential Explainable Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10018538
arxiv: 
abstract:
Recent advances in path-based explainable recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention thanks to the rich information from knowledge graphs. Most existing explainable recommendations only utilize static knowledge graphs and ignore the dynamic user-item evolutions, leading to less convincing and inaccurate explanations. Although some works boost the performance and explainability of recommendations through modeling the user's temporal sequential behavior, most of them either only focus on modeling the user's sequential interactions within a path or independently and separately of the recommendation mechanism. Moreover, some path-based explainable recommendations use random selection or traditional machine learning methods to decrease the volume of explainable paths, which cannot guarantee high quality of the explainable paths for the recommendation. To deal with the problem, recent path exploration use reinforcement learning to improve diversity and quality. However, unsupervised training leads to low-efficiency path exploration. Therefore, we propose a novel T emporal M eta-path Guided E xplainable R ecommendation leveraging R einforcement L earning ( TMER-RL ), which utilizes supervised reinforcement learning to explore item-item paths between consecutive items with attention mechanisms to sequentially model dynamic user-item evolutions on a dynamic knowledge graph for the explainable recommendation. Extensive evaluations of TMER-RL on two real-world datasets show state-of-the-art performance compared to recent strong baselines.


Semantic and Structural View Fusion Modeling for Social Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9996130
Abstract:
Existing studies have shown that user-item interaction data and social relation data can be jointly used for enhancing the performance of social recommendation. However, limited research has a focus on investigating how to deeply exploit different views of social interaction structures and rating behavior differences for further improving social recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we propose to integrate information from both semantic and structural views for social recommendation. Specifically, we first design a collective intelligence-based strategy to reveal high-quality implicit relations for both users and items. Then, by reformulating all available nodes and relations as a heterogeneous graph, we define multiple semantic metapaths to capture diverse preferences for comprehensive user and item representations. While various metapaths enlarge the representation capacity of users and items, they also introduce noise and irrelevant information. We recall that, for the user-item interaction graph, different structure sizes (e.g., local and global structures) provide diverse and complementary information for recommendation. Motivated by this, we propose a semantic and structural view fusion framework for social recommendation (S4Rec), which consists of a deep graph model and a wide attentive SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model for rating prediction by taking the local and global structure as input and aggregating messages along the predefined metapaths. Finally, the two predicted results are adaptively fused to achieve the final both accurate and stable prediction. In addition, we treat the user's rating behavior difference as the relative position difference problem in the embedding space, and model it with TransH to improve the generalization ability of the main rating model. Extensive experiments on three open datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared with state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, our model outperforms other baseli...
