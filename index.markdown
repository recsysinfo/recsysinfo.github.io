**CRS-Que: A User-Centric Evaluation Framework for Conversational Recommender Systems**,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	An increasing number of recommendation systems try to enhance the overall user experience by incorporating conversational interaction. However, evaluating conversational recommender systems (CRSs) from the user’s perspective remains elusive. The GUI-based system evaluation criteria may be inadequate for their conversational counterparts. This paper presents our proposed unifying framework, CRS-Que, to evaluate the user experience of CRSs. This new evaluation framework is developed based on ResQue, a popular user-centric evaluation framework for recommender systems. Additionally, it includes user experience metrics of conversation (e.g., understanding, response quality, humanness) under two dimensions of ResQue (i.e., Perceived Qualities and User Beliefs). Following the psychometric modeling method, we validate our framework by evaluating two conversational recommender systems in different scenarios: music exploration and mobile phone purchase. The results of the two studies support the validity and reliability of the constructs in our framework and reveal how conversation constructs and recommendation constructs interact and influence the overall user experience of the CRS. We believe this framework could help researchers conduct standardized user-centric research for conversational recommender systems and provide practitioners with insights into designing and evaluating a CRS from users’ perspectives.

**Exploring the Landscape of Recommender Systems Evaluation: Practices and Perspectives**,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Recommender systems research and practice are fast-developing topics with growing adoption in a wide variety of information access scenarios. In this paper, we present an overview of research specifically focused on the emphevaluation of recommender systems. We perform a systematic literature review, in which we analyze 57 papers spanning six years (2017–2022). Focusing on the processes surrounding evaluation, we dial in on the methods applied, the datasets utilized, and the metrics used. Our study shows that the predominant experiment type in research on the evaluation of recommender systems is offline experimentation and that online evaluations are primarily used in combination with other experimentation methods, e.g., an offline experiment. Furthermore, we find that only a few datasets (MovieLens, Amazon review dataset) are widely used, while many datasets are used in only a few papers each. We observe a similar scenario when analyzing the employed performance metrics—a few metrics are widely used (precision, nDCG, and Recall), while many others are used in only a few papers. Overall, our review indicates that beyond-accuracy qualities are rarely assessed. Our analysis shows that the research community working on evaluation has focused on the development of evaluation in a rather narrow scope, with the majority of experiments focusing on a few metrics, datasets, and methods.

**On Item-Sampling Evaluation for Recommender System**,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Personalized recommender system plays a crucial role in modern society, especially in e-commerce, news, and ads area. Correctly evaluating and comparing candidate recommendation models is as essential as constructing ones. The common offline evaluation strategy is holding out some user-interacted items from training data and evaluating the performance of recommendation models based on how many items they can retrieve. Specifically, for any hold-out item or so-called target item for a user, the recommendation models try to predict the probability that the user would interact with the item, and rank it among overall items, this is called global evaluation. Intuitively, a good recommendation model would assign high probabilities to such hold-out/target items. Based on the specific ranks, some metrics like Recall@K and NDCG@K can be calculated to further quantify the quality of the recommender model. Instead of ranking the target items among all items, Koren [22] first proposed to rank them among a small sampled set of items, and then quantified the performance of the models, this is called sampling evaluation. Ever since then, there has been a large amount of work adopting sampling evaluation due to its efficiency and frugality. In recent work, Rendle and Krichene [24, 32] argued that the sampling evaluation is ”inconsistent” with respect to a global evaluation in terms of offline top-k metrics.

**Generating Usage-related Questions for Preference Elicitation in Conversational Recommender Systems**
27 Oct 2023,
[[PDF]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3629981)

		Abstract
	</summary>
	A key distinguishing feature of conversational recommender systems over traditional recommender systems is their ability to elicit user preferences using natural language. Currently, the predominant approach to preference elicitation is to ask questions directly about items or item attributes. Users searching for recommendations may not have deep knowledge of the available options in a given domain. As such, they might not be aware of key attributes or desirable values for them. However, in many settings, talking about the planned use of items does not present any difficulties, even for those that are new to a domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to preference elicitation by asking implicit questions based on item usage. As one of the main contributions of this work, we develop a multi-stage data annotation protocol using crowdsourcing, to create a high-quality labeled training dataset. Another main contribution is the development of four models for the question generation task: two template-based baseline models and two neural text-to-text models. The template-based models use heuristically extracted common patterns found in the training data, while the neural models use the training data to learn to generate questions automatically. Using common metrics from machine translation for automatic evaluation, we show that our approaches are effective in generating elicitation questions, even with limited training data. We further employ human evaluation for comparing the generated questions using both pointwise and pairwise evaluation designs. We find that the human evaluation results are consistent with the automatic ones, allowing us to draw conclusions about the quality of the generated questions with certainty. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of cases where the models show their limitations.

**Constrained Off-policy Learning over Heterogeneous Information for Fairness-aware Recommendation**,
26 Oct 2023,

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Fairness-aware recommendation eliminates discrimination issues to build trustworthy recommendation systems. Existing fairness-aware approaches ignore accounting for rich user and item attributes and thus cannot capture the impact of attributes on affecting recommendation fairness. These real-world attributes severely cause unfair recommendations by favoring items with popular attributes, leading to item exposure unfairness in recommendations. Moreover, existing approaches mostly mitigate unfairness for static recommendation models, e.g., collaborative filtering. Static models can not handle dynamic user interactions with the system that reflect users’ preferences shift through time. Thus, static models are limited in their ability to adapt to user behavior shifts to gain long-run user satisfaction. As user and item attributes are largely involved in modern recommenders and user interactions are naturally dynamic, it is essential to develop a novel method that eliminates unfairness caused by attributes meanwhile embrace the dynamic modeling of user behavior shifts. In this paper, we propose Constrained Off-policy Learning over Heterogeneous Information for Fairness-aware Recommendation (Fair-HINpolicy), which uses recent advances in context-aware off-policy learning to produce fairness-aware recommendations with rich attributes from a Heterogeneous Information Network. In particular, we formulate the off-policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) by dynamically constraining the fairness of item exposure at each iteration. We also design an attentive action sampling to reduce the search space for off-policy learning. Our solution adaptively receives HIN-augmented corrections for counterfactual risk minimization, and ultimately yields an effective policy that maximizes long-term user satisfaction. We extensively evaluate our method through simulations on large-scale real-world datasets, obtaining favorable results compared with state-of-the-art methods.

	Causality is gaining more and more attention in the machine learning community and consequently also in recommender systems research. The limitations of learning offline from observed data are widely recognized, however, applying debiasing strategies like Inverse Propensity Weighting does not always solve the problem of making wrong estimates. This concept paper contributes a summary of debiasing strategies in recommender systems and the design of several toy examples demonstrating the limits of these commonly applied approaches. Therefore, we propose to map the causality frameworks of potential outcomes and structural causal models onto the recommender systems domain in order to foster future research and development. For instance, applying causal discovery strategies on offline data to learn the causal graph in order to compute counterfactuals or improve debiasing strategies.

	Deep recommender systems (DRS) are critical for current commercial online service providers, which address the issue of information overload by recommending items that are tailored to the user’s interests and preferences. They have unprecedented feature representations effectiveness and the capacity of modeling the non-linear relationships between users and items. Despite their advancements, DRS models, like other deep learning models, employ sophisticated neural network architectures and other vital components that are typically designed and tuned by human experts. This article will give a comprehensive summary of automated machine learning (AutoML) for developing DRS models. We first provide an overview of AutoML for DRS models and the related techniques. Then we discuss the state-of-the-art AutoML approaches that automate the feature selection, feature embeddings, feature interactions, and model training in DRS. We point out that the existing AutoML-based recommender systems are developing to a multi-component joint search with abstract search space and efficient search algorithm. Finally, we discuss appealing research directions and summarize the survey.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	Fashion recommendation is a key research field in computational fashion research and has attracted considerable interest in the computer vision, multimedia, and information retrieval communities in recent years. Due to the great demand for applications, various fashion recommendation tasks, such as personalized fashion product recommendation, complementary (mix-and-match) recommendation, and outfit recommendation, have been posed and explored in the literature. The continuing research attention and advances impel us to look back and in-depth into the field for a better understanding. In this paper, we comprehensively review recent research efforts on fashion recommendation from a technological perspective. We first introduce fashion recommendation at a macro level and analyse its characteristics and differences with general recommendation tasks. We then clearly categorize different fashion recommendation efforts into several sub-tasks and focus on each sub-task in terms of its problem formulation, research focus, state-of-the-art methods, and limitations. We also summarize the datasets proposed in the literature for use in fashion recommendation studies to give readers a brief illustration. Finally, we discuss several promising directions for future research in this field. Overall, this survey systematically reviews the development of fashion recommendation research. It also discusses the current limitations and gaps between academic research and the real needs of the fashion industry. In the process, we offer a deep insight into how the fashion industry could benefit from the computational technologies of fashion recommendation.

		Abstract
	</summary>
	The textile and apparel industries have grown tremendously over the past few years. Customers no longer have to visit many stores, stand in long queues, or try on garments in dressing rooms, as millions of products are now available in online catalogs. However, given the plethora of options available, an effective recommendation system is necessary to properly sort, order, and communicate relevant product material or information to users. Effective fashion recommender systems (RSs) can have a noticeable impact on billions of customers’ shopping experiences and increase sales and revenues on the provider side.
	The goal of this survey is to provide a review of RSs that operate in the specific vertical domain of garment and fashion products. We have identified the most pressing challenges in fashion RS research and created a taxonomy that categorizes the literature according to the objective they are trying to accomplish (e.g., item or outfit recommendation, size recommendation, and explainability, among others) and type of side information (users, items, context). We have also identified the most important evaluation goals and perspectives (outfit generation, outfit recommendation, pairing recommendation, and fill-in-the-blank outfit compatibility prediction) and the most commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics.

Causal Inference for Knowledge Graph Based Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9996555
https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10046
Abstract:
Knowledge Graph (KG), as a side-information, tends to be utilized to supplement the collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation model. By mapping items with the entities in KGs, prior studies mostly extract the knowledge information from the KGs and inject it into the representations of users and items. Despite their remarkable performance, they fail to model the user preference on attribute in the KG, since they ignore that (1) the structure information of KG may hinder the user preference learning, and (2) the user's interacted attributes will result in the bias issue on the similarity scores. With the help of causality tools, we construct the causal-effect relation between the variables in KG-based recommendation and identify the reasons causing the mentioned challenges. Accordingly, we develop a new framework, termed Knowledge Graph-based Causal Recommendation (KGCR), which implements the deconfounded user preference learning and adopts counterfactual inference to eliminate bias in the similarity scoring. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed model on three datasets, including Amazon-book, LastFM, and Yelp2018 datasets. By conducting extensive experiments on the datasets, we demonstrate that KGCR outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, such as KGNN-LS (Wang et al., 2019), KGAT (Wang et al., 2019) and KGIN (Wang et al., 2021).


Contrastive Proxy Kernel Stein Path Alignment for Cross-Domain Cold-Start Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10005854
abstract
Cross-Domain Recommendation has been popularly studied to utilize different domain knowledge to solve the cold-start problem in recommender systems. In this paper, we focus on the Cross-Domain Cold-Start Recommendation ( CDCSR ) problem. That is, how to leverage the information from a source domain, where items are ’warm’, to improve the recommendation performance of a target domain, where items are ’cold’. It has two main challenges, i.e., (1) how to efficiently reduce the discrepancy between the latent embedding distribution across domains and (2) how to generate more robust and stable cold item embeddings. To address these two challenges, we propose CPKSPA , a cross-domain recommendation framework for the CDCSR problem. CPKSPA contains three modules, i.e., rating prediction module, embedding distribution alignment module, and contrastive augmentation module. To start with, we first utilize the rating prediction module to model user-item interactions. To solve the first challenge, we propose proxy Stein path alignment with typical-subgroup discovering algorithm in the embedding distribution alignment module. To tackle the second challenge, we propose the contrastive augmentation module which adopts contrastive augmentation learning to generate more stable and robust cold item embeddings. Our empirical study on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrates that CPKSPA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.


Dual-View Preference Learning for Adaptive Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10015846
arxiv: 
Abstract:
While recommendation systems have been widely deployed, most existing approaches only capture user preferences in the macro-view , i.e., the user's general interest across all kinds of items. However, in real-world scenarios, user preferences could vary with items of different natures, which we call the micro-view . Both views are crucial for fully personalized recommendation, where an underpinning macro-view governs a multitude of finer-grained preferences in the micro-view. To model the dual views, in this paper, we propose a novel model called Dual-View Adaptive Recommendation (DVAR). In DVAR, we formulate the micro-view based on item categories, and further integrate it with the macro-view. Moreover, DVAR is designed to be adaptive, which is capable of automatically adapting to the dual-view preferences in response to different input users and item categories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate user preferences in macro- and micro- views in an adaptive way, without relying on additional side information such as text reviews. Finally, we conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on several real-world datasets. Empirical results not only show that DVAR can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art recommendation systems, but also demonstrate the benefit and interpretability of the dual views.


Leveraging Long Short-Term User Preference in Conversational Recommendation via Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9964317
Conversational recommender systems (CRS) endow traditional recommender systems with the capability of dynamically obtaining users’ short-term preferences for items and attributes through interactive dialogues. There are three core challenges for CRS, including the intelligent decisions for what attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at each conversation turn. Previous methods mainly leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to learn conversational recommendation policies for solving one or two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated conversation and recommendation components. These approaches restrict the scalability and generality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In the light of these challenges, we tackle these three decision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to leverage different features that are important to each sub-problem and facilitate better unified policy learning in CRS, we propose two novel multi-agent RL-based frameworks, namely Independent and Hierarchical Multi-Agent UNIfied COnversational RecommeNders (IMA-UNICORN and HMA-UNICORN), respectively. In specific, two low-level agents enrich the state representations for attribute prediction and item recommendation, by combining the long-term user preference information from the historical interaction data and the short-term user preference information from the conversation history. A high-level meta agent is responsible for coordinating the low-level agents to adaptively make the final decision. Experimental results on four benchmark CRS datasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed frameworks significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. Extensive analyses further demonstrate the superior scalability of the MARL frameworks on the multi-round conversational recommendation.


Reinforcement Learning Based Path Exploration for Sequential Explainable Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10018538
arxiv: 
abstract:
Recent advances in path-based explainable recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention thanks to the rich information from knowledge graphs. Most existing explainable recommendations only utilize static knowledge graphs and ignore the dynamic user-item evolutions, leading to less convincing and inaccurate explanations. Although some works boost the performance and explainability of recommendations through modeling the user's temporal sequential behavior, most of them either only focus on modeling the user's sequential interactions within a path or independently and separately of the recommendation mechanism. Moreover, some path-based explainable recommendations use random selection or traditional machine learning methods to decrease the volume of explainable paths, which cannot guarantee high quality of the explainable paths for the recommendation. To deal with the problem, recent path exploration use reinforcement learning to improve diversity and quality. However, unsupervised training leads to low-efficiency path exploration. Therefore, we propose a novel T emporal M eta-path Guided E xplainable R ecommendation leveraging R einforcement L earning ( TMER-RL ), which utilizes supervised reinforcement learning to explore item-item paths between consecutive items with attention mechanisms to sequentially model dynamic user-item evolutions on a dynamic knowledge graph for the explainable recommendation. Extensive evaluations of TMER-RL on two real-world datasets show state-of-the-art performance compared to recent strong baselines.


Semantic and Structural View Fusion Modeling for Social Recommendation
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9996130
Abstract:
Existing studies have shown that user-item interaction data and social relation data can be jointly used for enhancing the performance of social recommendation. However, limited research has a focus on investigating how to deeply exploit different views of social interaction structures and rating behavior differences for further improving social recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we propose to integrate information from both semantic and structural views for social recommendation. Specifically, we first design a collective intelligence-based strategy to reveal high-quality implicit relations for both users and items. Then, by reformulating all available nodes and relations as a heterogeneous graph, we define multiple semantic metapaths to capture diverse preferences for comprehensive user and item representations. While various metapaths enlarge the representation capacity of users and items, they also introduce noise and irrelevant information. We recall that, for the user-item interaction graph, different structure sizes (e.g., local and global structures) provide diverse and complementary information for recommendation. Motivated by this, we propose a semantic and structural view fusion framework for social recommendation (S4Rec), which consists of a deep graph model and a wide attentive SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model for rating prediction by taking the local and global structure as input and aggregating messages along the predefined metapaths. Finally, the two predicted results are adaptively fused to achieve the final both accurate and stable prediction. In addition, we treat the user's rating behavior difference as the relative position difference problem in the embedding space, and model it with TransH to improve the generalization ability of the main rating model. Extensive experiments on three open datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared with state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, our model outperforms other baseli...
